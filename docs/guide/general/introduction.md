# Introduction

Storefront Api is a customizable, modular eCommerce API gateway. You can use this product to provide all your frontends - including mobile applications with single data source. **GraphQL support** let you to easily implement BFF ([Backend for Frontend](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/)) pattern. It unifies the interfaces between all the systems backing your frontend and lets you query multiple data sources with single HTTP request.

Storefront Api is **backend agnostic**. That means it's not an eCommerce backend itself. Out of the box it's provided with Read/Write integrations with [Magento1](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer), [EpiServer](https://github.com/makingwaves/epi-commerce-to-vue-storefront), [Magento2](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-vsbridge-indexer), [OpenCart](https://github.com/butopea/vue-storefront-opencart-vsbridge), [SpreeCommerce](https://github.com/spark-solutions/spree2vuestorefront)

The architecture is modular. Out of the box we provided a set of modules (`default-catalog`, `default-vsf`, `default-img`) implementing our agnostic eCommerce data formats.  By default all the catalog information are stored in ElasticSearch (read operations). The write operations are forwarded to the **dedicated API drivers** (Magento1, Magento2, Spree and others avaialble).

## Modules

Storefront Api do provide all the features, GraphQL schemas, ElasticSearch resolvers and API handlers via [Modules](../modules/introduction.md). That's it. The default schema and the features described in the further parts of the documentation have been implemented by the `default-catalog`, `default-img` and `default-vsf` modules. You can customize them, clone, modify or just disable.

Each individual module provide it's own:
- GraphQL schema and resolvers,
- ElasticSearch mappings,
- API methods - via express.js hanlders and middlewares.

## How does it connect with backend platforms?
This product manages to be platform-agnostic thanks to the [dedicated API connectors](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront#integrations) for eCommerce backend platforms. The data format in `storefront-api` is always the same for any platform, which means no matter what eCommerce backend you use, your frontend remains the same without any change.

It's a great strategy for migrations since you can easily migrate from one platform to another (or one version to another, e.g. Magento 1 to 2) without touching your frontend.

The API connector, by default, works in two phases:

- **data pump** is pulling static data (catalog, orders, etc.) from your eCommerce platform to Storefront Api Elasticsearch and changes its format to our [data schema](https://divanteltd.github.io/storefront-graphql-api-schema/). Once finished pulling the data, you can query the product catalog. After pumping the data into Elasticsearch is done, it will stay in sync with changes made on the backend platform and update its content accordingly.

- **dynamic calls API** - it's a set of REST API modules: user, cart, review etc. The dynamic API endpoints are located in the `src/api` folder and can be extended by custom extensions. The default API endpoints make use of the `PlatformFactory` which is calling the platform-specific API clients defined under the `src/platform`. Platform drivers works like a Proxy to the real eCommerce backend. [Check the API specification](./api.md)

Some of the most popular backend platforms already have their integrations ([Magento 2](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/mage2vuestorefront), [Magento 1](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge), [CoreShop](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/coreshop-vsbridge), [BigCommerce](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/bigcommerce2vuestorefront), [WooCommerce](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/woocommerce2vuestorefront)), but you can easily make your own with the [integration sdk](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-integration-sdk).

## Storefront Api configÂ file

Most of the Storefront configuration (like the active theme, backend API addresses, multistore setup, etc.) is done through its [config](./config.md) file that can be found under the `config` folder. The `default.json` file contains all the default setup.

For your own implementation you should create a `local.json` file in the same directory and include fields from `default.json` that you want to override. These two files will be merged in favor of `local.json` during the build process.

## What else
You may not believe me but this is all you need to know to start working with Storefront Api! Once you are done wrapping your head around the basics, just look around docs and visit community [slack](https://slack.vuestorefront.io) to dig deeper into the project.
